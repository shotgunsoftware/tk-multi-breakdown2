        The scan scene method is executed once at startup and its purpose is
        to analyze the current scene and return a list of references that are
        to be potentially operated on.

        The return data structure is a list of dictionaries. Each scene reference
        that is returned should be represented by a dictionary with three keys:

        - "node_name": The name of the 'node' that is to be operated on. Most DCCs have
          a concept of a node, path or some other way to address a particular
          object in the scene.
        - "node_type": The object type that this is. This is later passed to the
          update method so that it knows how to handle the object.
        - "path": Path on disk to the referenced object.
        - "extra_data": Optional key to pass some extra data to the update method
          in case we'd like to access them when updating the nodes.

        Toolkit will scan the list of items, see if any of the objects matches
        a published file and try to determine if there is a more recent version
        available. Any such versions are then displayed in the UI as out of date.
